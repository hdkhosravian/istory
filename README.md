# 1xcoder

# Overview

1xcoder is a platform which allows companies to create relevant learning
materials in the form of _bootcamps_ that prepare a candidate for a
particular job.

The learning materials are interactive and include automated tests, for
exercises, as well as reviews by peers or coaches. If a candidate
achieves a sufficiently high score, she is qualified for the job and
will receive a **guaranteed** job offer.

Apart from bootcamps written by individual companies to acquire suitable
candidates, there are also generic bootcamps. Authors can choose to make
a bootcamp generic, or specific to a particular company.

- Example of a generic bootcamp: "Certified Junior Ruby Coder"
- Example of a specific bootcamp: "Takhfifan Frontend Developer"

Companies can offer jobs based on test scores in bootcamps. This way, a
candidate can complete a bootcamp, which opens the doors to a variety of
companies.

Bootcamps can be free or paid. A free bootcamp is simply a bootcamp with
zero price. Free bootcamps must be generic.

# Availability of Bootcamps

## Generic Bootcamps

Generic bootcamps are available to any user, they can be free or paid -
the author can configure this.

If a bootcamp is free, it remains free forever.

A paid bootcamp can be converted to a free one, but this operation is
irreversible.

## Specific Bootcamps - Types

### Free specific bootcamps

The author pays a fee for each user that enrols. Users must apply for
enrolment.

### Paid specific bootcamps

Any user can enrol in a paid course.

# Relationship Between Bootcamps

## Dependency

Bootcamps can require other bootcamps in preparation. Example: Enrolment
"Level 5 JavaScript Coder" bootcamp could depend on the completion of
"Level 4 JavaScript Coder" bootcamp.

## Suggestion

Bootcamps can suggest other bootcamps. Example: "Ruby Coder" can suggest
"HTML Coder", which may help the user master the bootcamp.

# Initial Strategy

Create a set of specific bootcamps which represent a skill. Examples:

- Level 1 JavaScript Coder
- Level 1 HTML Coder
- Level 1 CSS Coder
- Level 1 Ruby Coder
- Level 1 ReactJS Coder
- Level 1 PostgreSQL Coder

Later on other bootcamps can be built with these as dependencies, so a
bootcamp for a particular job does not have to teach materials that are
already available elsewhere.
